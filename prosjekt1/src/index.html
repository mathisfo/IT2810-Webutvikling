            <h3>CSS Flexbox</h3>
            <p>I opted for CSS flexbox because I chose to align my art pieces horizontally. I created two divs containing each art element and wrapped them in a container div. The art divs are inline elements ordered within the flexbox system. 
            </p>

            <h3>Canvas and SVG</h3>
            <p>Canvas proved easier than SVG. I wrote a javascript function inspired by a mathematical equation found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25837158/how-to-draw-a-star-by-using-canvas-html5">here</a>. However I was not able to write the same star in SVG. I decided to calculate the points of a polygon numerically based on the 250x250 viewpoint with (125,125) as origo. As a consequence, there is a slight mismatch, nonetheless within acceptable measures.
                <br>
                <br>
            The animation for the Canvas is invoked by a javascript function that interchanges between two canvas renders. The animation applied on the SVG is a CSS transformation that rotates the SVG 60 degrees to the right.

            <h3>jQuery</h3>
            <p>jQuery enables fetching and manipulation of DOM elements. I used the slideToggle function to hide/show This documentation is shown and hidden with the slideToggle jQuery function. </p>

            <h3>Cross-browser testing</h3>
            <p>I have tested the website in Safari, Chrome and Opera. Expected behavior was shown across all platforms. The page is lacking responsive web design for very narrow viewpoints. I used Google Chromes interactive Responsive Web Design tool to check on different mobile phones and was satisfied with the result on tablets.</p>
